Project: LIRI Bot
LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface.

Overview
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives data in return.

Challenge
Use Node JS to create a LIRI bot, like iPhone's SIRI, but takes in commands through Language vs Speech using the following commands:

concert-this
